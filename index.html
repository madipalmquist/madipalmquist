                        This map identifies the density of the Hispanic population across the contiguous United States, with darker shades of blue indicating a higher Hispanic population in a given state and lighter shades indicating a lower population in that state. The key problem I wanted to understand through the creation of this map was learning how to make choropleth and proportional symbol maps using U.S. Census data at the national scale. Additionally, I wanted to address questions about where Census data comes from, how Census data is collected, and what the limitations of Census data are.  
                        </p>
                        I used the Symbology tool to change the maps to reflect certain information from the Census. In particular, I used it to display a proportional symbol map of the Hispanic population in each state and a choropleth map of the percentage of the Hispanic population in each state. I used the Layout tool to place these maps and edit their appearances, including activating the maps to zoom in on them. This map can be used to track and understand demographic patterns and trends and understand how to allocate resources for specific communities.  
                        </p>

                        This map identifies populations in Flint, Michigan that are most at risk for drinking poisonous tap water. The identification of these populations was found by locating areas in Flint within 0.3 miles of a TRI facility with water pollution over 10,000 tons, within 0.3 miles of a river, and within 0.2 miles of a service line thatâ€™s made from lead. The areas most at risk are identified on the map with blue, and they are overlaid on the ward boundaries from Michigan in purple. 
                        </p>
                        In order to locate these areas in Flint, I used the Buffer and Intersect tools to create zones that met the criteria and join them together. I also used the Add Join feature in the creation of this map to link lone data tables with geographic data on the map. This map helps to pinpoint areas that are at the highest risk for consuming contaminated water and also allow policymakers to understand the demographic impact of the water contamination and if water contamination is disproportionately impacting certain areas.

                        This map identifies outcomes from the 2020 election by county in Pennsylvania. The colors are in gradients to reflect whether a county swayed more strongly towards one candidate (i.e. dark red representing a larger proportion of Trump votes and dark blue representing a larger proportion of Biden votes). This map demonstrates that Biden won by more votes in more urban counties like Philadelphia County and Allegheny County and Trump won by more votes in more rural counties. 
                        </p>
                        To accomplish this map design, I used the Add New Field option under the attribute table to create a new field to represent the different proportion of votes for each candidate. Then, I utilized the Symbology tool to set the map to Unique Values and use the new field I had created to display the appropriate percentages and their respective gradients. This map can be used by politicians and their teams to identify areas where support is strong and areas where counties are swaying to one candidate by only a small percentage, which they may consider targeting to flip.
